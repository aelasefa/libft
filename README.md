## Description

The goal of `libft` is to provide implementations for common C functions such as string manipulation, memory management, and more. It is a useful library for low-level C programming and is commonly used in projects that require manual handling of memory, strings, and data structures.

This library is often used in coding bootcamps, C courses, and personal projects, offering reusable building blocks for larger applications.

## Features

- **String Manipulation**: Functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcat`, etc.
- **Memory Management**: Functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, etc.
- **Utilities**: Implementations for functions such as `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalpha`, `ft_tolower`, etc.
- **Data Structures**: (If applicable) Linked list functions, stack/queue utilities, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Safe memory allocation with functions like `ft_malloc` (if implemented).

## Installation

To get started with `libft`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
